# Refreshd

Refreshd is a project built for the [Devpost AWS Chatbot Hackathon](https://awschatbot2017.devpost.com/?ref_content=featured&ref_feature=challenge&ref_medium=discover) using Amazon Lex.
Nicole, the AI dementia care assistant is built on a completely serverless platform utilising many AWS services.
Nicole can add patients and manage reminders for them. Contacts for the patient can also be added and Nicole can auto dial them on the patients behalf via voice commands.
